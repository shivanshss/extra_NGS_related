# RNA Expression Project Initialization Script

This script automates the creation of a well-organized project directory tailored for RNA expression analysis. The structure it generates is designed to help you keep track of your data, analysis, scripts, and results in a systematic manner.

## Purpose of the Script

Imagine you're diving into the world of RNA expression analysis – studying how genes are active in different cells or conditions. This script acts as your project architect, setting up folders to store each piece of your analysis puzzle.

## How to Use the Script

1. **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have `bash` installed on your computer. Don't worry, it's usually available by default.

2. **Download the Script**: Clone this repository or copy the script into a local file on your computer.

3. **Run the Script**: Open a terminal window, navigate to the script's directory, and execute it using the following command:

   ```bash
   bash script_name.sh

Replace script_name.sh with the actual name of the script file.

    Follow the Prompts: The script will guide you to input a name for your project. Think of it as the code name for your RNA expression journey.

    Explore the Structure: The script will generate folders that correspond to different aspects of your analysis.

## Understanding the Project Structure

Upon execution, the script will create the following folder structure within your project directory:

kotlin

project_name/
├── data/
│   ├── raw_data/
│   └── processed_data/
├── analysis/
│   ├── preprocessing/
│   ├── differential_expression/
│   └── visualization/
├── results/
│   └── analysis_results/
├── docs/
│   ├── protocols/
│   └── analysis_notes/
├── scripts/
│   ├── preprocessing_scripts/
│   ├── differential_expression_scripts/
│   └── visualization_scripts/
├── figures/
│   ├── differential_expression_plots/
│   └── visualization_plots/
└── tmp/
    ├── preprocessing_tmp/
    ├── differential_expression_tmp/
    └── visualization_tmp/

## Tips for Effective Project Management

Here are some tips to help you make the most of this organized structure:

    Collaboration: If you're working with others, this structure ensures everyone knows where to find important files.

    Large Files: The .gitignore file helps you avoid adding big files to version control, which can slow things down.

    Automation: Tools like Snakemake or Nextflow can help automate your analysis steps, saving time and reducing errors.

    Documentation: Pretend you're writing a story for your future self or others. Detail each step and why you're doing it.

    Reproducibility: Saving intermediate files might seem strange, but it helps others reproduce your results later.

Celebrate Your Progress!

Once the script finishes, it will let you know. Take a look at your new project structure! For a tree-like view, use this command in the terminal:

bash

tree project_name
