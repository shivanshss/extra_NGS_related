# Project Organization Starter Kit

This script helps you create an organized structure for your project, especially if you're working with Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis. The structure makes it easier to keep track of your work, collaborate effectively, and maintain a record of your analysis steps.

## What Does This Script Do?

Imagine you're embarking on a journey of analyzing genetic data from high-tech sequencing machines. This script is like your map and toolkit for setting up a well-organized base camp before you start your adventure. It creates folders where you can store different parts of your work.

## How to Use the Script

1. **Before You Start**: Make sure you have `bash` installed on your computer. If you're not sure, don't worry – most computers come with it already.

2. **Download the Script**: If you haven't already, either clone the repository or simply copy the script into a text file on your computer.

3. **Run the Script**: Open your computer's terminal (a text-based interface to control your computer), navigate to the folder where the script is located, and type this command:

   ```bash
   bash script_name.sh

Replace script_name.sh with the actual name of the script.

    Follow the Instructions: The script will ask you to choose a name for your project. Think of it as a unique code name for your adventure.

    Voilà!: The script will create a bunch of folders for you. These folders are like neatly labeled boxes where you can put different things related to your project.

## What Do These Folders Mean?

When you open the main project folder, you'll see a bunch of folders with specific names:

    data: This is where you'll keep the raw and processed data. Think of raw data as the unprocessed stuff from the sequencing machine, and processed data as the more organized and cleaned-up version.

    analysis: Inside this folder, there are subfolders for each step of analysis. From preparing the data, aligning sequences, calling variants, to post-processing – each step has its own place.

    results: Once you've done your analysis, this is where you can put your results. It's like showing off your discoveries after a successful expedition.

    docs: This is where you can keep important documents, like protocols (instructions for each analysis step) and notes about what you did and why.

    scripts: If you're a coding wizard, this is where your magic spells (scripts) for different analysis steps can reside.

## Tips for a Successful Project

Here are a few tips to make the most out of this structure:

    Collaboration: If you're working with others, this setup makes it easier for everyone to know where things are.

    Big Files: Huge files can slow things down. The .gitignore file helps GitHub (a platform for sharing code) know what not to worry about.

    Automation: There are tools (like Snakemake or Nextflow) that help automate your analysis steps – making things faster and less error-prone.

    Documentation: Imagine you're leaving breadcrumbs for your future self or others. Document each step – what you did, why, and how.

    Reproducibility: Storing intermediate files might seem odd, but it helps others reproduce your results later.

Celebrate Your Start!

Once the script finishes, it will let you know. Take a look at your newly created project structure! To see it in a tree-like view, you can type this command in the terminal:

bash

tree project_name
